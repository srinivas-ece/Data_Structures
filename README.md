Data Structures in C Programming  
Repository by ak26009  

Purpose  
This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in the C language.
Hands-on experience with structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting/searching, etc.

Repository Structure  
- `Bubble sort/` — Example implementations of bubble sort (and variations) for arrays.  
- `Searching and Sorting/` — Code for other sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion, selection, quicksort) and searching routines (linear, binary).  
- `Linked List/` — Singly, doubly linked lists: insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.  
- `Queue/` — Code demonstrating queue operations (enqueue, dequeue) using arrays or linked lists.  
- `stack1.c` (and/or other stack files) — Stack implementation, push/pop operations, possibly using arrays or dynamic memory.
